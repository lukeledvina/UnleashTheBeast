player controller:
	i feel like turning should be somehow related to current velocity
	when moving forward, stop pressing forward key and start turning with
	existing velocity, it feels strange
		somewhat fixed now although kinda strange

allow player to break different breakables based on combo
	requires additional work on breakable
		make small, medium, large, breakable etc, or add a property on breakables that you set for each kind
		which specifies how much rage is needed to break it

also allow for slower acceleration to a top speed that can then be boosted by combo or other factors

no matter what try to maintain and emphasize player momentum


WHERE IS THE FUN?:
	in seeing things you touch get destroyed, and seeing the effects of your rampage
	feeling unstoppable
	
how to implement the fun:
	good animations & sfx for destruction
	seeing pedestrians run away in fear

UI:
	implement combo as a meter that drains over time
	for now just implement as numbers, do more if time allows


LEVELS:
	Shopping Mall
	Return to Zoo
	Office Building
