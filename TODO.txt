make player input allow player to slow down only to a certain point, not completely stop
also allow for slower acceleration to a top speed that can then be boosted by combo or other factors

when going around turns in the level, either player will have to move relative to camera, 
or the entire stage will have to rotate so that player can continue to move based
on x & y coordinate plane

no matter what try to maintain player momentum


LEVELS:
	Shopping Mall
	Return to Zoo
	Office Building
	
main thing is to just run around inside buildings, destroying smaller props to get points
larger props require more momentum? and give more points/combo

Almost like a racing game, where there is a linear set path, and you are trying to destroy as much as possible to build up combo & score
