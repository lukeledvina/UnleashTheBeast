track total objects destroyed, pass to the game over screen
same with score

make an actual level -> City Streets
	timer until you lose / get caught
control instructions
make art

maybe go down to just 3 combo levels, the more levels you have the more unique props have to be made

also allow for slower acceleration to a top speed that can then be boosted by combo or other factors

no matter what try to maintain and emphasize player momentum

DONT WORRY TOO MUCH ABT GRAPHICS, IMPLEMENT THEM, BUT MAINLY JUST MAKE THE GAME

WHERE IS THE FUN?:
	in seeing things you touch get destroyed, and seeing the effects of your rampage
	feeling unstoppable
	
how to implement the fun:
	good animations & sfx for destruction
	seeing pedestrians run away in fear

UI:
	implement combo as a meter that drains over time
	for now just implement as numbers, do more if time allows

ART:
	16x16 tiles
	32x48 player ( could increase )

	animation for bouncing off breakable, in code...
