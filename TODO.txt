when and where to update combo UI
increase player speed based on combo
allow player to break different breakables based on combo


also allow for slower acceleration to a top speed that can then be boosted by combo or other factors

no matter what try to maintain player momentum


WHERE IS THE FUN?:
	in seeing things you touch get destroyed, and seeing the effects of your rampage
	feeling unstoppable
	
how to implement the fun:
	good animations & sfx for destruction
	seeing pedestrians run away in fear

UI:
	setup container for labels ?

	implement combo as a meter that drains over time
	for now just implement as numbers, do more if time allows


LEVELS:
	Shopping Mall
	Return to Zoo
	Office Building
	
main thing is to just run around inside buildings, destroying smaller props to get points
larger props require more momentum? and give more points/combo
